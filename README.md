Steganography
</h1>

Steganography is the practice of representing information within another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of the information is not evident to human inspection.

This repository presents a simple way to hide a secret image inside another image:

![hiding](assets/EN_hiding.png)

As you can see, the result (the image on the right) is almost identical to the original image. However, there is a secret image encrypted inside that can be extracted:

![unhiding](assets/EN_unhiding.png)
